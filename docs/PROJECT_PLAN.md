## Current Progress Summary (Updated: 28 Aug 2025)

###  COMPLETED MILESTONES

**Week 1: Foundation Stabilization - COMPLETED**

-  ML Pipeline: Enhanced model integration with 79% accuracy for high-trust users
-  Trust Bar: Professional visualization with correct Z-Score calculations (50/30/20 weighting)
-  Error Handling: Comprehensive fallback systems and graceful degradation
-  UI Polish: Clean, professional interface without technical oversharing
-  Performance: Sub-millisecond response times achieved
 -  Testing: Test suite executed locally (11 tests passed); runtime warnings remain to triage (SHAP/sklearn numeric warnings and PyTestReturnNotNoneWarning)

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Model integration system with data transformation pipeline
- Enhanced trust assessment (ML + rule-based fallback)
- Combined risk assessment and trust scoring
- Admin panel with ML status monitoring
- Seamless user experience with professional design
- Scoped demo credentials in authentication UI (user app now shows only `demo_user`; admin demo remains admin-only)

### Repository status (quick map)

- `app.py` — Minimal launcher implemented (venv-aware, port handling, opens browser, returns process handle)
- `auth.py` — Context-aware auth UI (`context='user'|'admin'|'both'`) and signup/login; demo creds shown conditionally
- `app_user.py` — Gamified user app with missions, Z-Credits, trust bar, and SHAP insights integration via `shap_dashboard.py`
- `app_admin.py` — Admin dashboard with ML monitoring, SHAP admin view, system controls
- `shap_dashboard.py` — Interactive SHAP explanation views (waterfall, feature importance, plain language)
- `model_pipeline.py` / `model_integration.py` — Model training, prediction, SHAP integration, and fallback rule-based trust calculations
- `local_db.py` — SQLite schema, demo accounts (`demo_user`, `admin`), consent logging, gamification tables

### Next small, high-value tasks (recommended)

1. Triage pytest warnings and convert tests that `return` booleans into `assert` statements (improves test hygiene)
2. Add a short README section documenting how to run the launcher and the user/admin apps (one-liner commands and recommended venv activation)
3. (Optional) Replace visible admin demo credentials in UI with a "Request demo access" flow while keeping local demo accounts for development
4. Add a lightweight markdown lint step in CI or a local command to catch list/indentation issues automatically


###  IN PROGRESS

**Current Focus (Week 2-3 Advanced Features):**

1. **Model improvement pipeline for continuous learning** -  Ready for implementation
2. **API development for external integrations** -  Ready for implementation
