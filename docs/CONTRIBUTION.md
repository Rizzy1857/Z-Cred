# Contributing to Project Z-Score

## Overview

Project Z-Score is a hackathon prototype for PSB's FinTech Cybersecurity Hackathon 2025. This document outlines contribution guidelines for team members during the development phase.

## Team Structure

**Team Z-Row Members:**

- Abhinand
- Hrisheekesh  
- Alvin
- Anjana

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

1. **Main Branch Protection**: The `main` branch contains stable, demo-ready code
2. **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches for each component

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/shap-integration
   git checkout -b feature/trust-bar-ui
   git checkout -b fix/model-pipeline-errors
   ```

3. **Pull Requests**: All changes must go through pull requests with team review
4. **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add SHAP explainability to XGBoost model"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve model training convergence issues"
   git commit -m "ui: enhance Trust Bar with animated progress"
   ```

### Code Review Process

- **Reviewer Assignment**: Each PR requires review from at least one other team member
- **Focus Areas**: Functionality, code quality, demo readiness, documentation
- **Approval Required**: No direct pushes to main branch

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow Python style guide
- **Function Documentation**: Include docstrings for all functions

  ```python
  def calculate_trust_score(applicant_data):
      """
      Calculate Trust Bar score from applicant data.
      
      Args:
          applicant_data (dict): Applicant information and features
          
      Returns:
          dict: Trust score components and overall score
      """
  ```

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper exception handling
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints where beneficial for clarity

### File Organization

```
zscore/
 app.py                 # Main Streamlit application
 auth.py               # Authentication system
 local_db.py           # Database operations
 model_pipeline.py     # ML models and training
 requirements.txt      # Dependencies
 README.md            # This file
 data/
     applicants.db    # Main SQLite database
     sample_data/     # Demo datasets
```

### Database Guidelines

- **Migration Strategy**: Document all schema changes

2. **Documentation**: Complete technical and user documentation
3. **Presentation Materials**: Supporting slides and materials
4. **Backup Scenarios**: Alternative demo flows for contingencies

## Testing Guidelines

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Core functions must have test coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Demo Testing**: All presentation scenarios must work reliably
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure Streamlit compatibility

### Test Data Management

- **Synthetic Data**: Realistic but artificial datasets for demos
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Performance Data**: Monitor response times and resource usage

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups

- **Format**: Brief status updates via team chat
- **Content**: Yesterday's progress, today's plan, blockers
- **Duration**: Keep concise and focused

### Weekly Reviews

- **Demo Practice**: Test presentation scenarios
- **Code Review**: Collective review of major changes  
- **Planning**: Adjust priorities based on progress

### Issue Tracking

- **GitHub Issues**: Track bugs, features, and improvements
- **Priority Labels**: Critical, Important, Enhancement
- **Assignment**: Clear ownership for each issue

## Demo Preparation Standards

### Code Quality for Demos

- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes, no crashes during demos
- **Loading States**: Show progress indicators for long operations
- **Data Validation**: Prevent invalid inputs from breaking the system
- **Fallback Scenarios**: Backup plans if primary demo data fails

### Presentation Readiness

- **Stable Features**: Only include thoroughly tested functionality
- **Clear Narratives**: Each demo scenario tells a compelling story
- **Time Management**: Practice within presentation time limits
- **Technical Backup**: Local setup with offline capabilities

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy (DPDPA)

- **Consent Logging**: Every data collection must be logged with consent
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for demo purposes
- **Synthetic Data Priority**: Use artificial data to avoid privacy risks
- **Consent Withdrawal**: Implement and test data deletion workflows

### RBI Guidelines

- **Fund Flow Simulation**: Demonstrate compliant financial flows
- **Documentation**: Generate required regulatory documents
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive logging for compliance review

## Documentation Standards
