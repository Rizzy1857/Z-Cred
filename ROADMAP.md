- Regulatory consultation with RBI compliance experts
- Initial fundraising or sponsorship discussions
- Team expansion planning

**Key Milestones:**

- [ ] 5 confirmed pilot partners (for expansive options and interactions)
- [ ] RBI compliance legal review completed
- [ ] Scalable cloud infrastructure deployed
- [ ] Mobile-first interface launched


### Performance Analysis (Month 5-6)

**Objective: Data-driven improvement and scaling preparation**

**Model Enhancement:**

- Real data model retraining
- Bias detection and mitigation validation
- Predictive accuracy optimization
- Feature importance analysis

**Business Metrics:**

- Partner satisfaction scores
- User progression from Obscurity to credit access
- Operational cost per assessment
- Regulatory audit readiness

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Phase 1 (Current): Prototype Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python + SQLite
- **ML:** scikit-learn + XGBoost + SHAP
- **Deployment:** Local/Single server

### Phase 2: MVP Stack

- **Frontend:** React/Flutter hybrid
- **Backend:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- **ML:** MLflow + Docker containers
- **Deployment:** AWS/GCP with load balancing

## Regulatory Milestone Timeline

### Immediate (0-6 Months)

- [ ] DPDPA compliance certification
- [ ] RBI LSP registration completion
- [ ] Data localization compliance verification
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

### Medium-term (6-18 Months)

- [ ] RBI sandbox program participation
- [ ] Credit bureau integration approvals
- [ ] Account Aggregator ecosystem certification
- [ ] International data sharing agreements

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 Metrics

- **Technical:** 99%+ uptime during demos
- **Business:** Hackathon placement and recognition
- **Impact:** Proof of concept validation

### Phase 2 Metrics

*yet to decide...*

### Phase 3&4 Metrics

*Post prototype phase, hence yet to create one for phase 3&4*

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Model bias and fairness concerns**
  - Mitigation: Continuous bias monitoring and diverse training data
- **Data privacy violations**
  - Mitigation: Privacy-by-design architecture and regular audits
- **Scalability limitations**
  - Mitigation: Cloud-native architecture and performance testing

### Business Risks

- **Regulatory changes**
  - Mitigation: Active regulatory engagement and compliance buffer
- **Partner dependencies**
  - Mitigation: Diverse partner ecosystem and white-label options
- **Competition from established players**
  - Mitigation: Strong IP protection and continuous innovation

### Market Risks

- **Economic downturn affecting microfinance**
  - Mitigation: Counter-cyclical value proposition and risk management tools
- **Technology adoption barriers**
  - Mitigation: Offline-first design and extensive field training

## Conclusion

This roadmap transforms Project Z-Score from a hackathon prototype into a national financial inclusion infrastructure. Each phase builds systematically on previous achievements while maintaining focus on regulatory compliance, technical excellence, and measurable social impact.

The path requires disciplined execution, strategic partnerships, and continuous adaptation to regulatory and market changes. Success metrics emphasize both business sustainability and social impact, ensuring the project fulfills its mission of empowering India's underbanked population while building a viable, scalable enterprise.
